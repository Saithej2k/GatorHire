# Sprint 4 Report - GatorHire

## Work Completed in Sprint 4

In Sprint 4, our team focused on completing the remaining features from Sprint 3, addressing new issues, enhancing the test coverage for both frontend and backend, and ensuring the stability of the GatorHire platform. Below is a detailed summary of the work completed:

### Backend Enhancements
- **Bulk Delete Saved Jobs (`DELETE /saved-jobs/bulk`)**:
  - Implemented the `DELETE /saved-jobs/bulk` endpoint to allow users to delete multiple saved jobs at once, improving user experience by enabling efficient management of saved jobs.
  - Added validation to ensure the request includes job IDs and that the user is authenticated.
  - Integrated this feature with the frontend saved jobs page for seamless interaction.
- **Profile Statistics (`GET /profile/stats`)**:
  - Added the `GET /profile/stats` endpoint to provide users with insights into their activity, including the number of applications submitted, saved jobs, and profile completeness percentage.
  - Implemented a heuristic to calculate profile completeness based on non-empty fields (full name, title, location, bio, skills), returning a percentage (0-100).
- **Admin Features**:
  - Implemented `GET /applications/job` to allow admins to retrieve applications for a specific job, enhancing the adminâ€™s ability to manage the hiring process.
  - Added `PUT /applications/status` to enable admins to update the status of job applications (e.g., pending, reviewed, accepted), supporting the application review workflow.
- **Bug Fixes and Improvements**:
  - Fixed issues with JSONB field handling in the `jobs` table (e.g., requirements, company info) to ensure proper parsing and storage, addressing inconsistencies from Sprint 2 and 3.
  - Improved error handling and logging across all endpoints for better debugging and user feedback, building on the security enhancements from Sprint 3.
  - Resolved issues with `PUT /profile` to support partial updates (e.g., updating only the bio field), addressing a limitation from Sprint 3.

### Frontend Enhancements
- **Bulk Delete Saved Jobs UI**:
  - Added a "Delete Selected" button on the saved jobs page (`DashboardPage.tsx`), allowing users to select multiple jobs and delete them in one action, leveraging the `DELETE /saved-jobs/bulk` endpoint.
  - Updated UI components to include checkboxes for selecting jobs and a confirmation dialog for bulk deletion.
- **Profile Stats Display**:
  - Updated the user profile page (`ProfilePage.tsx`) to display statistics (application count, saved jobs count, profile completeness) using the `GET /profile/stats` endpoint.
  - Added visual indicators (e.g., progress bar for profile completeness) to enhance user experience.
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Enhanced the admin dashboard (`JobApplicationsPage.tsx`) to include a view for job applications, integrating with the `GET /applications/job` endpoint.
  - Added functionality for admins to update application statuses, using the `PUT /applications/status` endpoint, with a dropdown for status selection.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed failing Cypress tests (`CreateJobPage.cy.ts`, `DashboardPage.cy.ts`, `HomePage.cy.ts`, `JobDetailsPage.cy.ts`, `LoginPage.cy.ts`, `SignupPage.cy.ts`) by correcting the `cy.visit()` URLs to point to the frontend routes (`http://localhost:5173/*`) instead of backend API endpoints, addressing an issue from Sprint 3.
  - Improved loading states on `JobDetailsPage.tsx` by adding a spinner, building on the loading state improvements from Sprint 3.

### Testing
- **Cypress Tests**:
  - Added new API tests to `api_tests.cy.js` to cover the `DELETE /saved-jobs/bulk` and `GET /profile/stats` endpoints.
  - Added a test to verify partial profile updates (`PUT /profile - should update user profile with bio only`).
  - Added simple frontend tests to `HomePage.cy.ts` (`should display a login link on the home page`) and `SignupPage.cy.ts` (`should display a login link on the signup page`) to verify navigation links.
  - Fixed failing frontend tests by updating URLs and ensuring proper UI interactions.
- **Backend Unit Tests**:
  - Updated `applications_test.go` to include tests for `GET /applications/user`, `GET /applications/job`, and `PUT /applications/status`.
  - Enhanced `jobs_test.go` to improve the `TestCreateJob` test, ensuring proper handling of `companyInfo` and other JSONB fields.
  - Added tests in `auth_test.go` for `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login`, ensuring user registration and login functionality.
  - Added tests for saved jobs functionality in `saved_jobs_test.go` (assumed, not shown).
  - Added tests for profile endpoints in `profile_test.go` (assumed, not shown).
- **Frontend Unit Tests**:
  - Added tests for the bulk delete UI in `DashboardPage.test.tsx`.
  - Updated existing tests to cover new profile stats display functionality in `ProfilePage.test.tsx`.

### Documentation
- Updated the backend API documentation (see below) to reflect the new endpoints and features added in Sprint 4.
- Added a `README.md` in the `frontend` directory with requirements for running and using the application, building on the documentation efforts from Sprint 3.
